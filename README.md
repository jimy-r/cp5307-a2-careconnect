# CareConnect - CP5307 Assessment 2

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and associated documentation for the CareConnect mobile application, developed as part of the CP5307 Assessment 2 - Mobile App Development unit.

CareConnect is designed to provide a centralised platform for caregivers to manage health-related information, schedules, and communication for the individuals they care for.

## Proposed Core Functionality

Based on the project plan, the application aims to include the following core features:

*   **Medication Scheduler:** Manage medication entries, dosages, frequencies, and instructions with automated reminders, logging, and tracking.
*   **Appointment Manager:** A shared calendar for health appointments with notifications, calendar integration, and space for detailed notes.
*   **Daily Routine Tracker (Optional):** Ability to log daily activities such as meals, sleep, and hygiene.
*   **Shared Calendar & Timeline View:** Consolidated view of all care activities.
*   **Real-Time Communication:** In-app messaging or shared journal for updates and notes.
*   **Emergency Information:** Quick access to vital details like contacts, allergies, and primary care physician.
*   **Emergency Alerts:** A one-touch button to notify caregivers in critical situations.

*(Note: The implementation status of these features will evolve throughout the development process.)*

## UI / UX Design Principles

The application prioritises an accessible and intuitive user interface, considering users who may be older, stressed, or less tech-savvy. Key elements include:

*   Clear Dashboard Home Screen
*   Simple Tabbed Navigation
*   Customisable Notification Centre
*   Accessibility Design (legible fonts, high contrast, simple navigation)

*   **Backend (if applicable):** [e.g., Firebase, Node.js, AWS]
*   **Database (if applicable):** [e.g., Firestore, MongoDB, SQLite]
*   **Other Libraries:** [Key libraries/packages used]
